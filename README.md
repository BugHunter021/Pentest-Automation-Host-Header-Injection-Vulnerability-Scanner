# Host Header Vulnerability Scanner

The Host Header Vulnerability Scanner is a command-line tool designed to detect and identify potential Host Header Injection vulnerabilities in web applications. By testing the behavior of a web application when manipulated with a custom Host header value, this tool helps identify possible security risks and assists in securing the application against such attacks.
